   - Technical risk analysis in architecture reviews
   - Team members encouraged to raise new risks

2. **Risk Assessment Criteria**
   - **Probability**: Low (<30%), Medium (30-70%), High (>70%)
   - **Impact**: Low (minor delays), Medium (feature impact), High (project impact)
   - **Risk Score**: Combination of probability and impact

### Monitoring & Control

1. **Risk Tracking**
   - Risks reviewed weekly in status meetings
   - Risk register updated with new information
   - Risk owners responsible for monitoring
   - Metrics established for key risk areas

2. **Risk Response Planning**
   - **Avoid**: Change approach to eliminate risk
   - **Mitigate**: Reduce probability or impact
   - **Transfer**: Shift risk to third party
   - **Accept**: Acknowledge and monitor

3. **Contingency Planning**
   - Specific triggers identified for each risk
   - Contingency plans documented in advance
   - Resources allocated for contingency execution

## Resource Optimization Strategies

   - Backend developers familiar with data validation
   - Regular knowledge sharing sessions

2. **Resource Leveling**
   - Balance workload across sprints
   - Identify resource bottlenecks in advance
   - Adjust sprint scope based on resource availability

3. **Critical Path Management**
   - Identify tasks on the critical path
   - Prioritize resources for critical path tasks
   - Monitor critical path progress closely

4. **Skill Matrix Maintenance**
