# User Story: File-Based Data Storage (US 9.1)

## Description
**As a** developer,  
**I want to** implement a structured JSON file storage system,  
**So that** data persists between sessions.

## Priority
High

## Story Points
7

## Acceptance Criteria
- Directory structure for user, book, and review data
- JSON file format definition
- File locking mechanism for concurrent operations
- Index files for efficient lookups

## Technical Tasks

### Design Implementation
1. **Create Storage Architecture**
   - Design directory structure:
     ```
     data/
     ├── users/
     │   └── [user_id].json
     ├── books/
     │   └── [book_id].json
     ├── reviews/
     │   └── [review_id].json
     └── indexes/
         ├── users.json
         ├── books.json
         └── reviews.json
     ```
   - Define JSON schemas for each entity
   - Create ID generation strategy
   - Design indexing approach

2. **Plan Concurrency Handling**
   - Research file locking mechanisms
   - Design transaction-like operations
   - Create conflict resolution strategy
   - Plan backup and recovery process

3. **Design Query Patterns**
   - Create lookup patterns for common queries
   - Design filtering and sorting strategies
   - Plan pagination implementation
   - Define relationships between entities

### Backend Implementation
1. **Implement File System Utilities**
   - Create file reading/writing functions
   - Implement directory management
   - Add file existence checks
   - Create error handling for I/O operations

2. **Create Entity Storage Classes**
   - Implement base storage class
   - Create entity-specific storage classes
   - Add validation before storage
   - Implement CRUD operations

3. **Implement File Locking**
   - Add lock acquisition before writing
   - Create lock timeout handling
   - Implement lock release after operations
   - Design deadlock prevention

4. **Create Transaction Support**
   - Implement atomic write operations
   - Create rollback capability
   - Add logging for transactions
   - Design recovery from failed operations

### Indexing Implementation
1. **Create Index Structure**
   - Design index file format
   - Implement index creation
   - Add index updating on entity changes
   - Create efficient lookup mechanism

2. **Implement Search Indexes**
   - Create text search indexes
   - Implement category/tag indexes
   - Add date-based indexes
   - Create composite indexes for complex queries

3. **Add Index Maintenance**
   - Implement reindexing capability
   - Create index validation
   - Add scheduled index maintenance
   - Design index optimization

### Integration Implementation
1. **Connect Storage with API Layer**
   - Create data access layer
   - Implement repository pattern
   - Add caching for frequent queries
   - Design query building utilities

2. **Implement Performance Optimization**
   - Add batch operations
   - Create memory-efficient streaming
   - Implement partial data loading
   - Design query optimization

## Dependencies
- US 1.1: Project Initialization

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test file I/O operations
- Verify locking mechanism
- Test entity CRUD operations
- Validate index operations

### Integration Testing
- Test concurrent operations
- Verify index consistency
- Test query performance
- Validate transaction handling

### Performance Testing
- Test with large datasets
- Verify query optimization
- Test concurrent read/write operations
- Validate indexing performance

### Stress Testing
- Test system under high load
- Verify error recovery
- Test disk space limitations
- Validate backup and restore

## Definition of Done
- File storage system is implemented with proper structure
- Concurrent operations are handled safely
- Indexing provides efficient data lookup
- Transaction-like guarantees are in place
- All tests are passing with adequate coverage
- Code has been reviewed and approved by team
- Documentation is updated with data storage details
