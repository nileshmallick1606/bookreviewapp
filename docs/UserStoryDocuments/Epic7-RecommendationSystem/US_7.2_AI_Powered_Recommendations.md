# User Story: AI-Powered Recommendations (US 7.2)

## Description
**As a** user,  
**I want to** receive personalized book recommendations,  
**So that** I can discover books matching my preferences.

## Priority
Medium

## Story Points
8

## Acceptance Criteria
- Integration with OpenAI API
- Recommendations based on user reviews, ratings, and genres
- Maximum 5-second response time
- Fallback to basic recommendations if API fails
- Caching mechanism to reduce API calls

## Technical Tasks

### Frontend Implementation
1. **Create Recommendation Component**
   - Design recommendation cards with Material UI
   - Implement grid layout for recommendations
   - Create loading state with skeleton placeholders
   - Add refresh button for manual recommendations update

2. **Implement Recommendation Service**
   - Create API service to fetch personalized recommendations
   - Handle loading and error states
   - Implement caching for recent recommendations
   - Set up timeout handling for long-running requests

3. **Design Recommendations UI**
   - Create recommendation section for home page
   - Design dedicated recommendations page
   - Add explanations for recommendation basis
   - Implement empty and error states

4. **Add User Preference Collection**
   - Create genre preference selector in user profile
   - Implement favorite books functionality
   - Design onboarding flow for new users to gather preferences

### Backend Implementation
1. **Set Up OpenAI API Integration**
   - Configure OpenAI API client
   - Set up authentication and API keys
   - Create rate limiting and usage tracking
   - Implement error handling for API failures

2. **Create Recommendation Engine**
   - Design prompt engineering for GPT-4mini
   - Create user data preparation service
   - Implement recommendation generation algorithm
   - Format and validate API responses

3. **Implement Recommendation Endpoint**
   - Create GET /api/v1/recommendations endpoint
   - Add user-specific context to requests
   - Implement response formatting
   - Set up authentication requirement

4. **Create Caching Layer**
   - Implement in-memory cache for recommendations
   - Set up time-based cache invalidation (24 hours)
   - Create user-specific caching strategy
   - Implement cache bypass option for refresh requests

5. **Develop Fallback System**
   - Create popularity-based recommendation algorithm
   - Implement fallback triggers (API failure, timeout)
   - Ensure seamless user experience during fallback

### Integration Implementation
1. **Connect Frontend and Backend**
   - Ensure API endpoint is accessible from frontend
   - Test recommendation flow end-to-end
   - Verify caching and refresh functionality

2. **Optimize Performance**
   - Implement parallel processing where applicable
   - Optimize data preparation for recommendations
   - Add performance monitoring
   - Tune timeout thresholds

3. **Implement Error Recovery**
   - Create graceful degradation for API failures
   - Add retry mechanism with exponential backoff
   - Implement user-friendly error messages
   - Ensure recommendations are always available (even if basic)

## Dependencies
- US 2.2: User Login
- US 3.1: Book Listing
- US 4.1: Create Review
- US 6.2: Edit Profile (for genre preferences)
- US 7.1: Basic Recommendations (fallback system)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Frontend:**
  - Test recommendation component rendering
  - Verify loading and error states
  - Test cache handling logic
  - Validate recommendation display

- **Backend:**
  - Test OpenAI API integration
  - Verify recommendation algorithm
  - Test caching mechanism
  - Validate fallback system
  - Test prompt construction

### Integration Testing
- Test API endpoint with various user profiles
- Verify caching and invalidation
- Test fallback mechanism during API failures
- Verify recommendation quality and relevance

### End-to-End Testing
- Test complete recommendation flow
- Verify refresh functionality
- Test timeout handling
- Verify recommendations update after profile changes

### Performance Testing
- Measure response time under various conditions
- Test system behavior under high load
- Verify caching effectiveness
- Test API call optimization

### Security Testing
- Verify API key security
- Test for data leakage in recommendations
- Ensure user data privacy in OpenAI prompts
- Test authentication requirements

## Definition of Done
- AI-powered recommendations are working correctly
- Response time is under 5 seconds for 95% of requests
- Fallback system provides recommendations when AI is unavailable
- Caching effectively reduces API calls
- Recommendations are personalized based on user data
- All tests are passing with adequate coverage
- Code has been reviewed and approved by team
- Documentation is updated with recommendation system details
