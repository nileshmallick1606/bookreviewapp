# EPIC8: UI/UX Responsive Design - Implementation Plan

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** August 28, 2025  
**Epic:** UI/UX and Responsive Design  
**User Stories:** US 8.1 (Responsive Layout), US 8.2 (Material UI Implementation)

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation plan for EPIC8: UI/UX Responsive Design. The goal is to create a fully responsive application that works seamlessly across various devices while implementing a consistent Material UI design system. The plan breaks down the work into 10 discrete, testable units with clear deliverables and acceptance criteria.

## 2. Current State Assessment

Based on analysis of the existing codebase:

1. **Material UI Setup**:
   - Material UI is installed (v5.14.10) with basic configuration
   - Theme is configured in `_app.tsx` with minimal settings
   - No comprehensive breakpoint system or responsive utilities

2. **Component Structure**:
   - Layout component exists with basic structure
   - Navbar has partial responsive implementation
   - Most components lack proper responsive design

3. **Responsive Utilities**:
   - Limited use of Material UI's responsive utilities
   - One instance of `useMediaQuery` in `BookRecommendationCarousel.tsx`
   - No consistent approach for responsive design across components
