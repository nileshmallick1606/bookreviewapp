# User Story: AWS Deployment (US 12.2)

## Description
**As a** DevOps engineer,  
**I want to** deploy the application to AWS,  
**So that** it is accessible to users in a scalable and reliable environment.

## Priority
High

## Story Points
8

## Acceptance Criteria
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates are created
- Application is deployed to AWS with proper environments
- Auto-scaling is configured for variable load
- Security best practices are implemented
- Monitoring and alerting are set up
- Deployment process is automated through CI/CD

## Technical Tasks

   - Configure backup strategies
   - Implement encryption
   - Create parameter groups
   - Set up replication (if needed)

### Application Deployment
1. **Create Deployment Pipeline**
   - Set up CodePipeline or GitHub Actions
   - Configure build and test stages
   - Implement deployment stages
   - Create approval workflows
   - Set up rollback procedures

2. **Implement Frontend Deployment**
   - Configure S3 for static hosting
   - Set up CloudFront distribution
   - Implement SSL certificates
   - Create cache control strategies
   - Set up route handling

3. **Create Backend Deployment**
   - Configure ECS services or Elastic Beanstalk
   - Implement task definitions
   - Set up environment variables
   - Create service discovery
   - Implement health checks

### Security Implementation
1. **Implement Network Security**
   - Configure security groups
   - Set up WAF rules
   - Implement DDoS protection
   - Create network isolation
   - Set up VPN access (if needed)

2. **Create Identity and Access Management**
   - Set up IAM roles and policies
   - Implement least privilege access
   - Create service roles
   - Set up identity federation (if needed)
   - Implement MFA for critical operations

3. **Implement Data Security**
   - Configure encryption at rest
   - Set up encryption in transit
   - Implement key management
   - Create data backup policies
   - Design disaster recovery

### Operations Setup
1. **Implement Monitoring**
   - Set up CloudWatch dashboards
   - Create custom metrics
   - Implement log aggregation
   - Set up X-Ray tracing
   - Create performance monitoring

2. **Create Alerting System**
   - Configure CloudWatch alarms
   - Set up notification endpoints
   - Implement escalation procedures
   - Create automated recovery actions
   - Design on-call rotation

3. **Implement Cost Management**
   - Create resource tagging strategy
   - Implement budget alerts
   - Set up cost allocation
   - Create resource optimization
   - Implement reserved instances or savings plans

## Dependencies
- US 12.1: Docker Containerization
- US 1.3: CI/CD Pipeline Creation

## Testing Strategy

### Infrastructure Testing
- Validate IaC templates
- Test resource provisioning
- Verify network configuration
- Test security controls
- Validate environment isolation

### Deployment Testing
- Test deployment pipeline
- Verify blue-green deployment
- Test rollback procedures
- Validate configuration management
- Test multi-environment deployments

### Performance Testing
- Test auto-scaling behavior
- Verify load balancing
- Test database performance
- Validate CDN configuration
- Test under production-like load

### Security Testing
- Test network security controls
