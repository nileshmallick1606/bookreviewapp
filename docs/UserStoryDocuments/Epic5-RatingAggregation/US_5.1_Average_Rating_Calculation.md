# User Story: Average Rating Calculation (US 5.1)

## Description
**As a** system administrator,  
**I want to** automatically calculate and update average ratings for books,  
**So that** users see accurate rating information.

## Priority
High

## Story Points
4

## Acceptance Criteria
- Algorithm to calculate average rating to one decimal place
- Automatic recalculation when reviews are added/edited/deleted
- Display of average rating on book listings and detail pages
- Display of review count alongside average rating

## Technical Tasks

### Algorithm Implementation
1. **Create Rating Calculation Service**
   - Implement average rating formula
   - Add rounding to one decimal place
   - Create handling for edge cases (no reviews)
   - Implement efficient calculation for large numbers of reviews

2. **Add Trigger Points**
   - Create hooks for review creation events
   - Implement triggers for review updates
   - Add handlers for review deletions
   - Create manual recalculation functionality

3. **Optimize Performance**
   - Implement incremental updates where possible
   - Create caching for frequently accessed ratings
   - Add batch processing for multiple updates
   - Implement background processing for large recalculations

### Backend Implementation
1. **Update Book Data Model**
   - Add average rating field to book model
   - Create review count property
   - Implement data validation
   - Add default values for new books

2. **Create Rating Update Service**
   - Implement function to update book ratings
   - Create transaction handling for consistency
   - Add logging for rating changes
   - Implement error recovery

3. **Set Up Index Updates**
   - Update search indexes with new ratings
   - Implement rating-based sorting functionality
   - Create top-rated books index
   - Add rating distribution statistics (optional)

### Frontend Implementation
1. **Create Rating Display Components**
   - Design visual star rating component
   - Implement numeric rating display
   - Create review count indicator
   - Add hover state with details

2. **Update Book List Component**
   - Add rating display to book cards
   - Implement sorting by rating
   - Create filtering by minimum rating
   - Add top-rated section (optional)

3. **Enhance Book Detail Page**
   - Add prominent rating display
   - Implement rating distribution chart (optional)
   - Create rating comparison to similar books (optional)
   - Add trend indicator for rating changes (optional)

### Integration Implementation
1. **Connect Backend and Frontend**
   - Ensure rating updates propagate to UI
   - Test real-time updates when possible
   - Verify consistent display across views
   - Implement fallback for calculation errors

## Dependencies
- US 3.1: Book Listing
- US 3.3: Book Detail View
- US 4.1: Create Review

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Algorithm:**
  - Test calculation with various inputs
  - Verify rounding behavior
  - Test edge cases (no reviews, all 5-star, all 1-star)
  - Validate incremental update logic

- **Backend:**
  - Test rating update triggers
  - Verify transaction handling
  - Test concurrency with simultaneous updates
  - Validate error recovery

- **Frontend:**
  - Test rating component rendering
  - Verify display formatting
  - Test responsive behavior
  - Validate sorting and filtering by rating

### Integration Testing
- Test end-to-end rating updates
- Verify rating calculation after review actions
- Test rating display consistency across views
- Verify search and filtering by rating

### Performance Testing
- Test calculation speed with large review counts
- Verify efficient updates for frequent changes
- Test bulk recalculation performance
- Validate caching effectiveness

### Data Integrity Testing
- Test for calculation drift over time
- Verify consistency between stored and calculated values
- Test recovery after system failures
- Validate data integrity during concurrent operations

## Definition of Done
- Average ratings are calculated correctly to one decimal
- Ratings update automatically after review changes
- Rating display is consistent across all views
- Performance is optimized for large numbers of reviews
- All tests are passing with adequate coverage
- Code has been reviewed and approved by team
- Documentation is updated with rating calculation details
