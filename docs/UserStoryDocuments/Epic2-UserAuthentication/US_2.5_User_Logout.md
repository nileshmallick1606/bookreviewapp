# User Story: User Logout (US 2.5)

## Description
**As a** logged-in user,  
**I want to** log out of my account,  
**So that** my session is terminated securely.

## Priority
High

## Story Points
2

## Acceptance Criteria
- Logout button in the user interface
- JWT token invalidation
- Redirect to login page after logout
- Session data cleared from browser

## Technical Tasks

### Frontend Implementation
1. **Create Logout UI**
   - Add logout button to navigation bar
   - Implement logout button in user dropdown menu
   - Create confirmation dialog for logout (optional)
   - Design logout success notification

2. **Implement Logout Functionality**
   - Create logout handler in authentication service
   - Clear JWT token from storage
   - Reset application state related to user
   - Implement redirect to login page

3. **Update Auth State Management**
   - Ensure auth context is updated on logout
   - Clear any user-related Redux state
   - Reset protected route access
   - Implement event listeners for auth state changes

4. **Handle Edge Cases**
   - Create automatic logout for expired tokens
   - Handle logout during ongoing operations
   - Implement cleanup for user-specific data
   - Add retry mechanism for failed logout attempts

### Backend Implementation
1. **Create Logout Endpoint**
   - Implement POST /api/v1/auth/logout endpoint
   - Add token to blacklist or invalidation mechanism
   - Clear HTTP-only cookies if used
   - Return appropriate success response

2. **Implement Token Invalidation**
   - Create token blacklist or invalidation mechanism
   - Set up cleanup for expired invalidated tokens
   - Implement check against blacklist in auth middleware
   - Add logging for security audit

3. **Handle Multi-Device Logout**
   - Consider implementing selective device logout
   - Create last active timestamp for sessions
   - Add optional "logout from all devices" functionality
   - Implement session tracking if required

### Integration Implementation
1. **Connect Frontend and Backend**
   - Ensure logout endpoint is called properly
   - Verify token invalidation works correctly
   - Test redirect after logout

2. **Implement Security Checks**
   - Ensure all user data is properly cleared
   - Verify no authenticated requests after logout
   - Test against token reuse after logout

## Dependencies
- US 2.2: User Login

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Frontend:**
  - Test logout button functionality
  - Verify token and state clearing
  - Test redirect after logout
  - Validate auth context updates

- **Backend:**
  - Test token invalidation mechanism
  - Verify cookie clearing functionality
  - Test middleware rejection of invalidated tokens

### Integration Testing
- Test complete logout flow
- Verify token invalidation on the server
- Test authentication state after logout
- Verify redirect to login page

### End-to-End Testing
- Complete logout flow from user perspective
- Verify inability to access protected routes after logout
- Test automatic logout for expired tokens
- Verify login is required after logout

### Security Testing
- Test token invalidation effectiveness
- Verify all session data is properly cleared
- Test against token reuse after logout
- Check for secure cookie handling

## Definition of Done
- Logout button is accessible in the UI
- Token is properly invalidated on the server
- User is redirected to login page after logout
- All user session data is cleared from browser
- All tests are passing with adequate coverage
- Code has been reviewed and approved by team
