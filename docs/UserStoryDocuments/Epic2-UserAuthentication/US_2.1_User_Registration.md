# User Story: User Registration (US 2.1)

## Description
**As a** new user,  
**I want to** create an account with my email and password,  
**So that** I can access the platform's features.

## Priority
High

## Story Points
5

## Acceptance Criteria
- Registration form with email, password, and name fields
- Email validation and password strength requirements
- Successful account creation with confirmation message
- Error handling for existing email addresses

## Technical Tasks

### Frontend Implementation
1. **Create Registration Form Component**
   - Design form layout with Material UI components
   - Implement form fields for email, password, and name
   - Add password confirmation field
   - Create form validation logic

2. **Implement Client-Side Validation**
   - Validate email format
   - Check password strength (min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char)
   - Ensure password and confirmation match
   - Validate name field is not empty
   - Display appropriate validation messages

3. **Create Registration Service**
   - Implement API service call to registration endpoint
   - Handle success and error responses
   - Set up loading states for form submission

4. **Design Registration UI Flow**
   - Create registration page layout
   - Add links between login and registration pages
   - Implement success message and redirect after registration
   - Add error message display for failed registration attempts

### Backend Implementation
1. **Create User Data Model**
   - Implement User model with required fields:
     - User ID (UUID)
     - Email
     - Hashed password
     - Name
     - Created/updated timestamps

2. **Implement Password Security**
   - Set up bcrypt for password hashing (10 rounds)
   - Create password validation utility

3. **Create Registration Endpoint**
   - Implement POST /api/v1/auth/register endpoint
   - Validate request body for required fields
   - Check for existing email in the system
   - Create new user record with hashed password
   - Return appropriate response (success/error)

4. **Implement Email Validation**
   - Validate email format
   - Set up unique email constraint
   - Create helpful error messages for validation failures

5. **Set Up File Storage for User Data**
   - Create directory structure for user data
   - Implement file writing for new user records
   - Set up indexing for user email lookup

### Integration Implementation
1. **Connect Frontend and Backend**
   - Ensure API endpoint is accessible from frontend
   - Test data flow from form to backend
   - Verify error handling works correctly

2. **Create End-to-End Registration Flow**
   - Implement complete registration flow
   - Test with valid and invalid data
   - Verify user record is created correctly

## Dependencies
- US 1.1: Project Initialization
- US 1.2: Infrastructure Setup (for deployment)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Frontend:**
  - Test form validation logic
  - Verify form submission handling
  - Test loading state management
  - Validate error message display

- **Backend:**
  - Test password hashing functionality
  - Verify email validation logic
  - Test user creation service
  - Validate duplicate email detection

### Integration Testing
- Test API endpoint with valid and invalid data
- Verify frontend-backend integration
- Test user file creation and indexing

### End-to-End Testing
- Complete registration flow with valid data
- Test validation error display for invalid data
- Verify redirect after successful registration
- Test duplicate email error handling

### Security Testing
- Ensure passwords are properly hashed
- Verify registration rate limiting (if implemented)
- Test input validation for XSS vulnerabilities
- Check HTTPS enforcement for registration requests

## Definition of Done
- Registration form is fully functional
- Validation works correctly for all fields
- User records are created and stored properly
- Error handling is implemented for all edge cases
- All tests are passing with adequate coverage
- Code has been reviewed and approved by team
- Documentation is updated with registration flow details
