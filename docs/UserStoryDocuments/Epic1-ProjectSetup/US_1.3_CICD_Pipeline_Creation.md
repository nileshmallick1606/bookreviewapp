# User Story: CI/CD Pipeline Creation (US 1.3)

## Description
**As a** DevOps engineer,  
**I want to** set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions,  
**So that** code can be automatically tested, built, and deployed.

## Priority
High

## Story Points
6

## Acceptance Criteria
- GitHub Actions workflow for frontend testing and building
- GitHub Actions workflow for backend testing and building
- Infrastructure pipeline that applies Terraform configurations
- Deployment pipeline that deploys containers to target environments

## Technical Tasks

### CI Pipeline Configuration
1. **Set Up Frontend CI Workflow**
   - Create GitHub Actions workflow file for frontend
   - Configure Node.js environment and dependencies installation
   - Set up linting and code style verification
   - Configure unit and integration tests
   - Implement build process
   - Set up code coverage reporting
   - Configure caching for dependencies

2. **Set Up Backend CI Workflow**
   - Create GitHub Actions workflow file for backend
   - Configure Node.js environment and dependencies installation
   - Set up linting and code style verification
   - Configure unit and integration tests
   - Implement build process
   - Set up code coverage reporting
   - Configure caching for dependencies

3. **Implement Code Quality Checks**
   - Set up SonarQube integration
   - Configure security scanning
   - Implement dependency vulnerability checks
   - Set up code quality gates

### CD Pipeline Configuration
1. **Create Infrastructure Pipeline**
   - Develop GitHub Actions workflow for Terraform
   - Configure AWS credentials and permissions
   - Implement Terraform plan and apply steps
   - Set up approval process for infrastructure changes
   - Configure state locking
   - Implement environment-specific workflows

2. **Create Frontend Deployment Pipeline**
   - Develop GitHub Actions workflow for frontend deployment
   - Configure Docker build and push
   - Implement deployment to EC2 or ECS
   - Set up environment-specific deployments (dev, staging, prod)
   - Configure rollback mechanisms
   - Implement post-deployment checks

3. **Create Backend Deployment Pipeline**
   - Develop GitHub Actions workflow for backend deployment
   - Configure Docker build and push
   - Implement deployment to EC2 or ECS
   - Set up environment-specific deployments (dev, staging, prod)
   - Configure rollback mechanisms
   - Implement post-deployment checks

### Secrets and Environments Configuration
1. **Set Up GitHub Secrets**
   - Configure AWS credentials
   - Set up Docker registry credentials
   - Add environment-specific variables
   - Configure API keys for external services

2. **Configure Environment-Specific Settings**
   - Create environment configurations in GitHub
   - Set up environment protection rules
   - Configure required reviewers for production deployments
   - Set up environment-specific variables

### Monitoring and Notifications
1. **Implement Pipeline Notifications**
   - Configure email notifications for pipeline failures
   - Set up Slack notifications for important events
   - Create dashboard for pipeline status

2. **Set Up Pipeline Monitoring**
   - Implement job metrics collection
   - Configure duration monitoring
   - Set up failure alerting
   - Create historical performance tracking

## Dependencies
- US 1.1: Project Initialization
- US 1.2: Infrastructure Setup

## Testing Strategy

### Pipeline Testing
- Test CI pipeline with sample code changes
- Verify test failures are properly reported
- Ensure build artifacts are correctly generated
- Test deployment to development environment

### Security Testing
- Verify secret handling in pipelines
- Test access controls for protected environments
- Validate credential rotation procedures

### End-to-End Testing
- Perform complete code-to-deploy test
- Verify rollback procedures
- Test blue-green deployment approach (if applicable)
- Validate post-deployment health checks

### Manual Testing
- Review pipeline logs for clarity and troubleshooting capability
- Verify notification systems work correctly
- Test manual approval processes

## Definition of Done
- All CI/CD pipelines are implemented and working
- Code quality checks are in place
- Security scanning is integrated
- Infrastructure can be deployed through the pipeline
- Application deployment is automated
- Environment-specific configurations are working
- Documentation for the pipelines is complete and clear
- Team members understand how to use and troubleshoot the pipelines
