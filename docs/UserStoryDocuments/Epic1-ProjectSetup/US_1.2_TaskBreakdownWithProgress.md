## Acceptance Criteria
- Infrastructure is defined as code using Terraform
- Docker containers are configured for both frontend and backend
- Local development environment works with Docker Compose
- CI/CD pipeline is configured for infrastructure deployment
- Documentation is provided for all infrastructure components

## Implementation Notes

### Terraform Modules
- Networking module configures VPC with public and private subnets across multiple AZs
- Security module defines security groups with least privilege access
- Compute module sets up Auto Scaling Groups with ALB for high availability
- Storage module manages S3 buckets with appropriate access policies

### Docker Configuration
- Frontend container uses Nginx for serving static assets
- Backend container runs Node.js with proper environment variables
- Multi-stage builds optimize image size and security
- Docker Compose simplifies local development environment setup

### CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated infrastructure deployment
- Separate workflows for application deployment
- Approval gates for production deployment

## Documentation Created
1. Terraform Infrastructure Guide (terraform_guide.md)
2. Docker Configuration Guide (docker_guide.md)
3. CI/CD Pipeline Guide (cicd_pipeline.md)
4. Environment Variables Guide (environment_variables.md)
5. Monitoring and Logging Guide (monitoring_logging.md)

## Technical Debt and Future Improvements

| Item | Description | Priority |
|------|-------------|----------|
| TD1  | Implement Infrastructure testing with Terratest | Medium |
| TD2  | Add disaster recovery configuration | High |
| TD3  | Implement infrastructure cost monitoring | Low |
| TD4  | Configure cross-region replication for high availability | Medium |
| TD5  | Implement infrastructure security scanning in CI/CD | High |

## Review Notes
- Infrastructure code follows best practices for modularity and reusability
- Security configurations follow the principle of least privilege
- All infrastructure components are defined as code for consistency
- Documentation provides comprehensive guidance for development and operations teams

## Time Tracking
- Estimated: 40 hours
- Actual: 36 hours (so far)
- Remaining: ~8 hours

## Dependencies
- US_1.1 (Project Initialization) - âœ… Completed
- Access to AWS account with appropriate permissions - âœ… Granted
