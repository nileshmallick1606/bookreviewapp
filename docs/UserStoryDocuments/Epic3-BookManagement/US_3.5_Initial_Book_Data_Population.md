   - Add options for count and parameters
   - Create progress indicators
   - Implement success and error reporting

2. **Test with Application**
   - Verify data compatibility with frontend
   - Test search functionality with generated data
   - Validate filtering and sorting
   - Ensure performance with full dataset

## Dependencies
