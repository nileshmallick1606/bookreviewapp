   - Implement session timeout
   - Add concurrent session handling
   - Create session revocation
   - Implement session monitoring

### Authentication Security Monitoring
1. **Create Security Logging**
   - Implement authentication event logging
   - Create failed attempt tracking
   - Add session lifecycle logging
   - Implement privilege escalation logging
   - Create security event alerting

2. **Set Up Security Monitoring**
   - Implement login pattern analysis
   - Create geographic anomaly detection
   - Add impossible travel detection
   - Implement user behavior analytics
   - Create security dashboard

3. **Create Incident Response**
   - Design security incident workflow
