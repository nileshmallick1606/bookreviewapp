# User Story: Backend Unit Testing (US 11.1)

## Description
**As a** developer,  
**I want to** implement comprehensive unit tests for the backend code,  
**So that** I can ensure the reliability and correctness of individual components.

## Priority
High

## Story Points
6

## Acceptance Criteria
- Unit test framework is set up and configured
- Test coverage is at least 80% for all backend code
- Tests are automated and can be run with a single command
- Test reports are generated after each test run
- CI/CD pipeline includes running unit tests
- All core functions have associated unit tests

   - Create secure configuration tests

## Dependencies
- US 10.1: RESTful API Design
- US 9.1: File-Based Data Storage

## Testing Strategy

### Development Testing
- Run tests during development
- Test specific components during implementation
- Use TDD approach where appropriate
- Run tests before committing code
- Verify test coverage locally

### Continuous Integration Testing
- Run all tests on each pull request
- Test on multiple Node.js versions
- Verify coverage thresholds
- Generate test reports
- Block merging if tests fail

### Code Quality Testing
- Run static analysis during testing
- Check for code quality issues
- Test for memory leaks
- Verify async/await patterns
- Test error handling

### Regression Testing
- Run full test suite regularly
- Test against previous releases
- Verify fixed bugs remain fixed
- Test backward compatibility
- Run performance comparison tests

## Definition of Done
- Unit test framework is set up and configured
- Test coverage meets or exceeds 80% threshold
- All core components have associated tests
- Tests run successfully in CI/CD pipeline
- Test reports are generated and accessible
- All tests pass with no failures
- Code has been reviewed and approved
- Documentation includes testing instructions
