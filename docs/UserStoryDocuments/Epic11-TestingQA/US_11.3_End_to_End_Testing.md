# User Story: End-to-End Testing (US 11.3)

## Description
**As a** developer,  
**I want to** implement end-to-end tests that verify complete user workflows,  
**So that** I can ensure the application functions correctly from a user's perspective.

## Priority
High

## Story Points
7

## Acceptance Criteria
- End-to-end testing framework is set up and configured
- Critical user flows are covered by automated tests
- Tests run in a browser environment similar to production
- Test reports include screenshots and videos of failures
- Tests can be run against different environments
- CI/CD pipeline includes end-to-end testing

## Technical Tasks
