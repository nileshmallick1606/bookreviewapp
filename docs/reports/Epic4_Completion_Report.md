## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Structure
The implementation uses a file-based JSON storage system as specified in the project requirements:
- Each review is stored as a separate JSON file in `/data/reviews/`
- Review IDs use UUID format for uniqueness
- Review data is structured for easy migration to a database in the future
- Indexing is implemented for efficient retrieval by book ID and user ID

### API Design
The API follows RESTful principles with standardized response formats:
```json
{
  "status": "success|error",
  "data": {...} | null,
  "error": null | { "code": 400, "message": "Error details" }
}
```

### Authentication & Authorization

- Authorization checks to ensure users can only edit/delete their own reviews
- Public access for viewing reviews
