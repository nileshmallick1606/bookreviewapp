# Epic 1: Project Setup - Progress Report

## Epic Overview

Epic 1 focuses on the initial project setup, infrastructure configuration, and CI/CD pipeline creation for the BookReview Platform. This foundational epic lays the groundwork for all subsequent development by establishing the development environment, infrastructure, and deployment pipelines.

- Created project structure for frontend (Next.js) and backend (Express.js)
- Set up TypeScript configuration and compilation
- Configured linting and formatting tools
- Established base components and routing
- Created initial API structure and middleware
- Implemented health endpoints for both services

### Infrastructure Setup (US 1.2)
- Developed Terraform modules for networking, security, compute, and storage
- Created Docker configurations for frontend and backend services
- Implemented Docker Compose for local development
- Created comprehensive documentation for all infrastructure components
- Set up environment-specific configurations for development, staging, and production

### CI/CD Pipeline Creation (US 1.3)

- Set up approval gates for production deployment
- Established monitoring and notification integrations

## Key Deliverables

1. **Project Structure**
   - Frontend (Next.js) project structure
   - Backend (Express.js) project structure
   - TypeScript configuration
   - Code quality tools

2. **Infrastructure Code**
   - Terraform modules and configurations
   - Docker container definitions
   - Docker Compose for local development
   - Environment-specific settings

3. **CI/CD Configuration**
   - GitHub Actions workflows
   - Build and test automation
   - Deployment pipelines
   - Environment promotion processes

4. **Documentation**
   - Project setup guide
   - Infrastructure documentation
   - CI/CD pipeline guide
   - Environment variables guide
   - Security best practices

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Infrastructure Modularity
**Challenge**: Creating a Terraform structure that is both modular and easy to maintain while supporting multiple environments.  
**Solution**: Implemented a layered approach with reusable modules and environment-specific configurations, enabling consistent deployment across environments while allowing for targeted customization.

### Challenge 2: Container Optimization
**Challenge**: Optimizing Docker containers for both development experience and production performance.  
**Solution**: Created multi-stage builds with environment-specific configurations, significantly reducing image size while maintaining developer-friendly features in development.

### Challenge 3: State Management
**Challenge**: Managing Terraform state across multiple environments and team members.  
**Solution**: Implemented remote state with S3 and DynamoDB locking to enable collaboration while preventing concurrent state modifications.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Infrastructure costs exceeding budget | High | Medium | Implemented cost monitoring and auto-scaling limits; developed environment shutdown procedures for non-production |
| Security vulnerabilities in infrastructure | High | Low | Applied security best practices; scheduled regular security reviews; implemented least privilege principles |
| Development environment inconsistencies | Medium | Medium | Containerized local development environment; created comprehensive documentation; enforced configuration as code |

## Next Steps

1. **Complete US 1.2 (Infrastructure Setup)**
   - Finish integration testing of infrastructure deployment
   - Complete security review of infrastructure components
   - Finalize monitoring and logging configuration

2. **Complete US 1.3 (CI/CD Pipeline Creation)**
   - Implement environment-specific deployment workflows
   - Configure automated testing in the pipeline
   - Set up monitoring and alerting integrations
   - Create deployment verification tests

3. **Prepare for Epic 2 (User Authentication)**
   - Review infrastructure requirements for authentication
   - Plan integration with identity providers
   - Define security requirements for user data

## Dependencies for Other Epics

1. **Epic 2: User Authentication**
   - Depends on core infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline
   - Requires security groups and network configuration from US 1.2
   - Will use deployment pipeline from US 1.3

2. **Epic 3: Book Management**
   - Depends on backend API structure from US 1.1
   - Will use storage resources configured in US 1.2
   - Requires deployment pipeline from US 1.3

3. **All Subsequent Epics**
   - Depend on the development environment from US 1.1
   - Will use infrastructure components from US 1.2
   - Will rely on deployment workflows from US 1.3

## Timeline Update

- **Original Epic Estimate**: 3 weeks
- **Current Estimate**: 3 weeks (on schedule)
- **US 1.1**: Completed in 1 week (as planned)
- **US 1.2**: 90% complete, expected completion in 2-3 days
- **US 1.3**: 50% complete, expected completion in 4-5 days
- **Overall Epic Status**: On track for completion within original estimate

## Conclusion

Epic 1 has made substantial progress with the completion of US 1.1 and near completion of US 1.2. The project now has a solid foundation with well-structured code, comprehensive infrastructure as code, and the beginnings of an automated CI/CD pipeline. The remaining work focuses on finalizing the infrastructure testing and completing the CI/CD pipeline configuration.

The established infrastructure and pipelines will enable the team to move quickly on subsequent epics, with a focus on delivering value through new features rather than solving infrastructure and deployment challenges. The modular approach taken in Epic 1 will also allow for easy scaling and modification as the project evolves.
