   - Book creation and editing forms
   - Book deletion with confirmation
   - Data generation tool

4. **Services**
   - BookService for API communication
   - Form validation and error handling

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Structure
The implementation uses a file-based JSON storage system as specified in the project requirements:
- Each book is stored as a separate JSON file in `/data/books/`
- Book IDs use UUID format for uniqueness
- Book data is structured for easy migration to a database in the future

### API Design
The API follows RESTful principles with standardized response formats:
```json
{
  "status": "success|error",
  "data": {...} | null,
  "error": null | { "code": 400, "message": "Error details" }
}
```

### Authentication & Authorization
- Protected routes for admin operations using JWT middleware
- Role-based access control for book management features

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Manual Testing
All user stories have been manually tested to ensure they meet acceptance criteria:
- Book listing with various pagination and sorting options
- Search functionality with different queries
- Book detail view with all information correctly displayed
- Admin operations for creating, updating, and deleting books
- Data generation with various counts

### Issues and Resolutions
- Fixed TypeScript errors in the data generation script
- Resolved module import issues for lodash/debounce and axios
- Ensured consistent API communication approach using axios

## Key Achievements

1. **Responsive Design**: Implemented responsive layout for both desktop and mobile views
2. **Performance Optimization**: Added pagination and efficient data loading
3. **Developer Experience**: Created data generation tools for testing and development
4. **User Experience**: Implemented intuitive search with autocomplete
5. **Code Quality**: Maintained consistent coding patterns and type safety

## Lessons Learned

1. **TypeScript Configuration**: Proper configuration of TypeScript for different parts of the application (src vs. scripts) is essential
2. **Dependency Management**: Ensuring all required packages are installed and properly imported
3. **File-based Storage**: Implementing efficient file operations for a scalable data storage solution
4. **API Consistency**: Maintaining consistent patterns across different endpoints

## Next Steps and Recommendations

1. **Integration with Reviews**: Connect the book management system with the upcoming review functionality in EPIC4
2. **Automated Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests for all components
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Add monitoring for API response times and optimize as needed
4. **Enhanced Search**: Consider implementing full-text search for better search results
5. **Book Metadata**: Add more detailed book metadata like ISBN, publisher, etc.

## Conclusion

EPIC3 has been successfully completed, delivering a robust book management system that serves as a foundation for the BookReview platform. The implementation follows the architectural principles outlined in the technical requirements document and provides a seamless experience for both users and administrators.

The completion of this epic marks a significant milestone in the development of the BookReview platform, enabling the team to move forward with the implementation of the review and rating system in EPIC4.
