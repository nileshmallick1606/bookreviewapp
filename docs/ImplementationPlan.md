# BookReview Platform Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

After analyzing all user stories and their dependencies, I've developed a comprehensive implementation plan for the BookReview Platform. This plan is organized into 5 phases, with specific epics and user stories assigned to each phase based on dependencies, business value, and technical considerations.

The implementation approach follows a foundation-first strategy, building core functionality incrementally while enabling early testing and stakeholder feedback. The plan balances technical requirements with business needs, ensuring we deliver value throughout the development lifecycle while maintaining a solid architecture.

## Team Structure

For this project, we'll organize into three cross-functional teams:

1. **Core Platform Team**
   - Focus: Infrastructure, backend services, data management
   - Skills: Node.js, Express, data storage, DevOps
   - Size: 4-5 engineers

2. **Frontend Experience Team**
   - Focus: UI/UX, responsive design, frontend functionality
   - Skills: Next.js, React, Redux, Material UI
   - Size: 3-4 engineers

3. **Quality & Security Team**
   - Focus: Testing strategy, security implementation, performance
   - Skills: Testing frameworks, security best practices, CI/CD
   - Size: 2-3 engineers

Each team will have a tech lead reporting to the engineering manager. Teams will coordinate through daily standups and weekly cross-team sync meetings.
