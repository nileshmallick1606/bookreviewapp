# BookReview Platform - Sprint Planning Document

## Project Overview

The BookReview Platform is a web application that allows users to browse books, read and write reviews, and receive personalized recommendations. The platform will be developed using Next.js for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, and a file-based JSON storage system (with future database migration capability).

## Agile Methodology

We will follow a Scrum methodology with:
- 2-week sprint cycles
- Daily standups
- Sprint planning, review, and retrospective meetings
- Backlog grooming sessions every week

## Backlog Prioritization Criteria

User stories in the backlog are prioritized based on the following criteria:

1. **Foundation First**: Stories that establish technical foundation have highest priority
2. **Core User Value**: Features that deliver core user value come next
3. **Dependencies**: Stories with many dependents are prioritized higher
4. **Risk Reduction**: High-risk items are addressed earlier when possible
5. **Balance**: Each sprint includes a mix of frontend, backend, and infrastructure work

## Velocity and Capacity Planning

- Initial team capacity: ~40-50 story points per sprint (across all teams)
- Expected ramp-up: Sprint 1 at 60% capacity, Sprint 2 at 80%, full capacity by Sprint 3
- Planned contingency: 10-15% buffer per sprint for unexpected issues

## Sprint Cadence

| Activity | Frequency | Duration | Participants |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Sprint Planning | Every 2 weeks | 2 hours | All team members |
| Daily Standup | Daily | 15 minutes | All team members |
| Backlog Grooming | Weekly | 1 hour | Tech leads, PM, SM |
| Sprint Review | Every 2 weeks | 1 hour | All team members + stakeholders |
| Sprint Retrospective | Every 2 weeks | 1 hour | All team members |

## Key Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| File-based storage performance | Early load testing, design with future migration in mind |
| Authentication security issues | Security review of auth implementation, follow best practices |
| UI/UX consistency challenges | Establish component library early, design system documentation |
| API design scalability | Review API design patterns, implement versioning from the start |
| Technical debt accumulation | Allocate time in each sprint for refactoring and improvements |

## Communication Plan

- Daily standups for team alignment
- Weekly status updates to stakeholders
- Bi-weekly demos of completed features
- Shared Slack channel for cross-team communication
- Documentation maintained in project wiki

## Definition of Ready

Before a user story enters a sprint, it must:
- Have clear acceptance criteria
- Be estimated by the team
- Have all dependencies identified
- Be broken down into technical tasks
- Have mockups/designs if UI-related
- Have test criteria defined

## Definition of Done

A user story is considered done when:
- Code is implemented and meets acceptance criteria
- Tests are written and passing
- Code is reviewed and approved
- Documentation is updated
- Feature is deployed to staging environment
- QA verification is complete
- Product owner has approved the implementation
