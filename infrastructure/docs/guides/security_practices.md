# Security Best Practices for BookReview Platform Infrastructure

This document outlines the security best practices implemented in the BookReview Platform infrastructure.

## Network Security

### VPC and Subnet Design
- **Public-Private Subnet Architecture**: Application components with direct internet access requirements are placed in public subnets, while sensitive components like the application servers are placed in private subnets.
- **Network ACLs**: Additional layer of security at the subnet level, complementing security groups.

### Security Groups
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Security groups are configured to allow only necessary traffic.
- **Layered Security**: Different security groups for ALB, frontend, and backend components.
- **No Direct Access**: Backend servers are not directly accessible from the internet.

## Identity and Access Management (IAM)

### IAM Roles and Policies
- **Minimal Permissions**: EC2 instances are assigned only the permissions they require.
- **Instance Profiles**: Used to securely provide AWS credentials to EC2 instances.
- **No Hardcoded Credentials**: All access is managed through IAM roles, not access keys.

### Key Management
- **Parameter Store Integration**: Sensitive data should be stored in AWS Parameter Store or Secrets Manager.
- **Key Rotation**: SSH key pairs and other access credentials should be rotated regularly.

## Data Security

### Storage Security
- **S3 Bucket Policies**: Restrict access to authorized services and roles.
- **Public Access Blocking**: All S3 buckets have public access blocking enabled.
- **Encryption at Rest**: Data stored in S3 is encrypted using SSE-S3.
- **Versioning**: Enabled on all buckets to prevent accidental deletion and facilitate recovery.

### Data Transfer
- **Encryption in Transit**: All connections to AWS services use HTTPS/TLS.
- **VPC Endpoints**: When possible, use VPC endpoints to access AWS services without traversing the internet.

## Monitoring and Compliance

### Logging and Monitoring
- **CloudTrail**: Enabled for API activity monitoring.
- **VPC Flow Logs**: Enabled for network traffic analysis.
- **S3 Access Logging**: Enabled for auditing bucket access.
- **CloudWatch Alarms**: Set up for suspicious activity detection.

### Compliance
- **Regular Audits**: Infrastructure should be audited regularly for compliance with security policies.
- **Automated Scanning**: Use tools like AWS Config and Security Hub for continuous assessment.

## Application Security

### Container Security
- **Minimal Base Images**: Use minimal, security-focused base images for Docker containers.
- **Image Scanning**: Scan container images for vulnerabilities before deployment.
- **No Privileged Containers**: Containers should run with minimal privileges.

### Software Updates
- **Regular Patching**: Keep all systems updated with security patches.
- **AMI Updates**: Regularly update the AMIs used for EC2 instances.
- **Dependency Management**: Keep application dependencies updated to address security vulnerabilities.

## Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

### Data Backup
- **Regular Backups**: Implement automated backups for all critical data.
- **Cross-Region Replication**: For production environments, consider cross-region replication.

### High Availability
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Production environment uses a multi-AZ deployment for high availability.
- **Auto-scaling**: Ensures the application can handle load and recover from instance failures.

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Verify VPC configuration with public/private subnets
- [ ] Confirm security groups follow least privilege principle
- [ ] Validate IAM roles have minimal required permissions
- [ ] Ensure S3 buckets have public access blocking enabled
- [ ] Configure encryption for data at rest and in transit
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging for all components
- [ ] Implement regular security patching process
- [ ] Test disaster recovery procedures

This document should be reviewed and updated regularly as the infrastructure evolves and security best practices advance.
